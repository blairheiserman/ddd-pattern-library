# Bounded	Context
Multiple	 models	 are	 in	 play	 on	 any	 large	 project. They	 emerge	 for	 many	 reasons.	 Two	
subsystems	 commonly	 serve	 very	 different	 user	 communities,	 with	 different	 jobs,	 where	
different	models	may	be	useful.	Teams	working	independently	may	solve	the	same	problem	
in	different	ways	through	lack	of	communication.	The	tool	set	may	also	be	different,	meaning	
that	program	code	cannot	be	shared.

Multiple	 models	 are	 inevitable,	 yet	 when	 code	 based	 on	 distinct	 models	 is	 combined,	
software	 becomes	 buggy,	 unreliable,	 and	 difficult	 to	 understand.	 Communication	 among	
team	members	becomes	confused.	It	is	often	unclear	in	what	context	a	model	should	not	be	
applied.

Model	expressions,	like	any	other	phrase,	only	have	meaning	in	context.

## Therefore:
Explicitly	 define	 the	 context	 within	 which	 a	 model	 applies.	 Explicitly	 set	 boundaries	 in	
terms	 of	 team	 organization,	 usage	 within	 specific	 parts	 of	 the	 application,	 and	 physical	
manifestations	such	as	code	bases	and	database	schemas.	Apply	Continuous	Integration	to	
keep	 model	 concepts	 and	 terms	 strictly	 consistent	 within	 these	 bounds,	 but	 donâ€™t	 be	
distracted	or	confused	by	issues	outside.	Standardize	a	single	development	process	within	
the	context,	which	need	not	be	used	elsewhere.
