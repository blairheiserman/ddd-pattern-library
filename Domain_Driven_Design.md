# Domain Driven Design

Driven	Design	is	an	approach	to	the	development	of	complex	software	in	which	we:
1. Focus	on	the	[core	domain](Core_Domain.md).
2. Explore	 models in	 a	 creative	 collaboration	 of	 domain	 practitioners	
and	software	practitioners.
3. Speak	a	[ubiquitous	language](Ubiquitous_Language.md) within	an	explicitly	[bounded	context](Bounded_Context.md).

This	three-point	summary	of	DDD	depends	on	the	definition	of	the	terms,	which	are	defined	
in	this	booklet.
Many	projects	do	modeling	work	without	getting	much	real	benefit	in	the	end.	The	patterns	
of	 DDD	 distill	 successful	 practices	 from	 projects	 where	 dramatic	 benefits	 have	 come	 from	
modeling.	Taken	together,	they lay	out	a	quite	different	approach	to	modeling	and	software	
development	that	runs	from	fine	details	to	high-level	vision.	Rigorous	modeling	conventions	
must	be	balanced	with	free	exploration	of	models	in	collaboration	with	non-technical	people.	
Tactics	 and	 strategy	 must	 be	 combined	 to	 succeed,	 and	 DDD	 addresses	 both	 tactical	 and	
strategic	design.
