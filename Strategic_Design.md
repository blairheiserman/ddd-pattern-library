# Large-scale	Structure	for	Strategic	Design

In	a	large	system	without	any	overarching	principle	that	allows	elements	to	be	interpreted	in
terms	of	their	role	in	patterns	that	span	the	whole	design,	developers	cannot	see	the	forest	
for	 the	 trees.	We	need	 to	be	able	 to	understand	 the	role	of	an	individual	part	in	 the	whole	
without	delving	into	the	details	of	the	whole.

A	 “large-scale	 structure”	 is	 a	 language	 that	 lets	 you	 discuss	 and	 understand	 the	 system	 in	
broad	strokes.	A	set	of	high-level	concepts	or	rules,	or	both,	establishes	a	pattern	of	design	
for	an	entire	system.	This	organizing	principle	can	guide	design	as	well	as	aid	understanding.	
It	helps	coordinate	independent	work	because	 there	is	a	shared	concept	of	 the	big	picture:	
how	the	roles	of	various	parts	shape	the	whole.

## Therefore:

Devise	a	pattern	of	rules	or	roles	and	relationships	that	will	span	the	entire	system	and	that	
allows	 some	 understanding	 of	 each	 part’s	 place	 in	 the	 whole—even	 without	 detailed	
knowledge	of	the	part’s	responsibility.
