# Ubiquitous	Language

For	first	you	write	a	sentence,<br/>
And	then	you	chop	it	small;<br/>
Then	mix	the	bits,	and	sort	them	out<br/>
Just	as	they	chance	to	fall:<br/>
The	order	of	the	phrases	makes<br/>
No	difference	at	all.<br/>
— Lewis	Carroll,	“Poeta	Fit,	Non	Nascitur”

To	create	a	supple,	knowledge-rich	design	calls	 for	a	versatile,	shared	team	language,	and	a	
lively	experimentation	with	language	that	seldom	happens	on	software	projects.

Within	a	single	bounded	context,	language	can	be	fractured	in	ways	that	undermine	efforts	to	
apply	 sophisticated	 modeling.	 If	 the	 model	 is	 only	 used	 to	 draw	 UML	 diagrams	 for	 the	
technical	members	of	the	team,	then	it	is	not	contributing	to	the	creative	collaboration	at	the	
heart	of	DDD.

Domain	 experts	 use	 their	 jargon	 while	 technical	 team	 members	 have	 their	 own	 language	
tuned	 for	 discussing	 the	 domain	 in	 terms	 of	 design.	 The	 terminology	 of	 day-to-day	
discussions	is	disconnected	from	the	terminology	embedded	in	the	code	(ultimately	the	most	
important	product	of	a	software	project).	And	even	the	same	person	uses	different	language	
in	speech	and	in	writing,	so	that	the	most	incisive	expressions	of	the	domain	often	emerge	in	
a	transient	form	that	is	never	captured	in	the	code	or	even	in	writing.

Translation	blunts	communication	and	makes	knowledge	crunching	anemic.	

Yet	none	of	these	dialects	can	be	a	common	language	because	none	serves	all	needs.

Domain	 experts	 should	 object	 to	 terms	 or	 structures	 that	 are	 awkward	 or	 inadequate	 to	
convey	domain	understanding;	developers	should	watch	for	ambiguity	or	inconsistency	that	
will	trip	up	design.

Play	 with	 the	 model	 as	 you	 talk	 about	 the	 system.	 Describe	 scenarios	 out	 loud using	 the	
elements	and	interactions	of	the	model,	combining	concepts	in	ways	allowed	by	the	model.	
Find	easier	ways	to	say	what	you	need	to	say,	and	then	take	those	new	ideas	back	down	to	
the	diagrams	and	code.

With	 a	 ubiquitous	 language,	 the	model	 is	 not	 just	 a	 design	 artifact.	 It	 becomes	 integral	 to	
everything	the	developers	and	domain	experts	do	together.

## Therefore:

Use	the	model	as	the	backbone	of	a	language.	Commit	the team	to	exercising	that	language	
relentlessly	 in	 all	 communication	 within	 the	 team	 and	 in	 the	 code.	 Within	 a	 bounded	
context,	use	the	same	language	in	diagrams,	writing,	and	especially	speech.

Recognize	that	a	change	in	the	language	is	a	change	to	the	model.

Iron	out	difficulties	by	experimenting	with	alternative	expressions,	which	reflect	alternative	
models.	Then	refactor	the	code,	renaming	classes,	methods,	and	modules	to	conform	to	the	
new	 model.	 Resolve	 confusion	 over	 terms	 in	 conversation,	 in	 just	 the way	 we	 come	 to	
agree	on	the	meaning	of	ordinary	words.
