# Repositories
_Query	access	to	aggregates	expressed	in	the	ubiquitous	language._

Proliferation	 of	 traversable	associations	 used	 only	 for	 finding	 things	muddles	 the	model.	In	
mature	models,	queries	often	express	domain	concepts.	Yet	queries	can	cause	problems.

The	 sheer	 technical	 complexity	 of	 applying	 most	 database	 access	 infrastructure	 quickly	
swamps	 the	 client	 code,	 which	 leads	 developers	 to	 dumb-down	 the	 domain	 layer,	 which	
makes	the	model	irrelevant.

A	query	framework	may	encapsulate	most	of	that	technical	complexity,	enabling	developers	
to	pull	the	exact	data	they	need	from	the	database	in	a	more	automated	or	declarative	way,	
but	that	only	solves	part	of	the	problem.

Unconstrained	 queries	 may	 pull	 specific	 fields	 from	 objects,	 breaching	 encapsulation,	 or	
instantiate	a	few	specific	objects	from	the	interior	of	an	aggregate,	blindsiding	the	aggregate	
root	and	making	 it	 impossible	 for	 these	 objects	 to	enforce	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 domain	model.	
Domain	 logic	 moves	 into	 queries	 and	 application	 layer	 code,	 and	 the	 entities	 and	 value	
objects	become	mere	data	containers.

## Therefore:
For	each	type of	aggregate	that	needs	global	access,	create	a	service	that	can	provide	the	
illusion	of	an	in-memory	collection	of	all	objects	of	that	aggregateâ€™s	root	type.	Set	up	access	
through	a	well-known	global	interface.	Provide	methods	to	add	and	remove	objects,	which	
will	encapsulate	the	actual	insertion	or	removal	of	data	in	the	data	store.	Provide	methods	
that	 select	 objects	 based	 on	 criteria	 meaningful	 to	 domain	 experts.	 Return	 fully	
instantiated	 objects	 or	 collections	 of	 objects	 whose	 attribute	 values	 meet	 the	 criteria,	
thereby	encapsulating	the	actual	storage	and	query	technology,	or	return	proxies	that	give	
the	 illusion	 of	 fully	 instantiated	 aggregates	 in	 a	 lazy	 way.	 Provide	 repositories	 only	 for	
aggregate	 roots	 that	 actually	 need	 direct	 access.	 Keep	 application	 logic	 focused	 on	 the	
model,	delegating	all	object	storage	and	access	to	the	repositories.
